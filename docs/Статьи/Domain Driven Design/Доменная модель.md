The domain’s business logic is already inherently complex, so the objects used for modeling it should not introduce any additional accidental complexities. The model should be devoid of any infrastructural or technological concerns, such as implementing calls to databases or other external components of the system. This restriction requires the model’s objects to be plain old objects, objects implementing business logic without relying on or directly incorporating any infrastructural components or frameworks.
